extern int do_exec(char * xfn, char * pars, int spawn, unsigned needed,

/*
   The EXEC function.

      Parameters:

         xfn      is a string containing the name of the file
                  to be executed. If the string is empty,
                  the COMSPEC environment variable is used to
                  load a copy of COMMAND.COM or its equivalent.
                  If the filename does not include a path, the
                  current PATH is searched after the default.
                  If the filename does not include an extension,
                  the path is scanned for a COM, EXE, or BAT file
                  in that order.

         pars     The program parameters.

         spawn    If 0, the function will terminate after the
                  EXECed program returns, the function will not return.

                  NOTE: If the program file is not found, the function
                        will always return with the appropriate error
                        code, even if 'spawn' is 0.

                  If non-0, the function will return after executing the
                  program. If necessary (see the "needed" parameter),
                  memory will be swapped out before executing the program.
                  For swapping, spawn must contain a combination of the
                  following flags:

                     USE_EMS  (0x01)  - allow EMS swap
                     USE_XMS  (0x02)  - allow XMS swap
                     USE_FILE (0x04)  - allow File swap

                  The order of trying the different swap methods can be
                  controlled with one of the flags

                     EMS_FIRST (0x00) - EMS, XMS, File (default)
                     XMS_FIRST (0x10) - XMS, EMS, File

                  If swapping is to File, the attribute of the swap file
                  can be set to "hidden", so users are not irritated by
                  strange files appearing out of nowhere with the flag

                     HIDE_FILE (0x40)    - create swap file as hidden

                  and the behaviour on Network drives can be changed with

                     NO_PREALLOC (0x100) - don't preallocate
                     CHECK_NET (0x200)   - don't preallocate if file on net.

                  This checking for Network is mainly to compensate for
                  a strange slowdown on Novell networks when preallocating
                  a file. You can either set NO_PREALLOC to avoid allocation
                  in any case, or let the prep_swap routine decide whether
                  to do preallocation or not depending on the file being
                  on a network drive (this will only work with DOS 3.1 or
                  later).

         needed   The memory needed for the program in paragraphs (16 Bytes).
                  If not enough memory is free, the program will
                  be swapped out.
                  Use 0 to never swap, 0xffff to always swap.
                  If 'spawn' is 0, this parameter is irrelevant.

         envp     The environment to be passed to the spawned
                  program. If this parameter is NULL, a copy
                  of the parent's environment is used (i.e.
                  'putenv' calls have no effect). If non-NULL,
                  envp must point to an array of pointers to
                  strings, terminated by a NULL pointer (the
                  standard variable 'environ' may be used).

      Return value:

         0x0000..00FF: The EXECed Program's return code

         0x0101:       Error preparing for swap: no space for swapping
         0x0102:       Error preparing for swap: program too low in memory

/*
   The function pointed to by "spawn_check" will be called immediately
   before doing the actual swap/exec, provided that

      - the preparation code did not detect an error, and
      - "spawn_check" is not NULL.

   The function definition is
      int name (int cmdbat, int swapping, char *execfn, char *progpars)

   The parameters passed to this function are

      cmdbat      1: Normal EXE/COM file
                  2: Executing BAT file via COMMAND.COM
                  3: Executing COMMAND.COM (or equivalent)

      swapping    < 0: Exec, don't swap
                    0: Spawn, don't swap
                  > 0: Spawn, swap

      execfn      the file name to execute (complete with path)

      progpars    the program parameter string

   If the routine returns anything other than 0, the swap/exec will
   not be executed, and do_exec will return with this code.

   You can use this function to output messages (for example, the
   usual "enter EXIT to return" message when loading COMMAND.COM)
   and to do clean-up and additional checking.

   CAUTION: If swapping is > 0, the routine may not modify the
   memory layout, i.e. it may not call any memory allocation or
   deallocation routines.

   "spawn_check" is initialized to NULL.
